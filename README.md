All you need to know to leave Google Workspace without having to sacrifice functionality

### About

Google has recently announced that legacy (i.e. free) G-Suite accounts would be discontinued and replaced with paid Google Workspace accounts. Many individuals or small businesses have relied on hosting their custom domain's email on this service for free, and are now forced to pay or find another solution.

This document is meant to help these people find another solution if they prefer not to pay Google for the service.

Please consider contributing if you know of any other services not listed here that would help someone transition out of Google Workspace.

### SaaS or Self-host?

The question for some will be: do I pay for a service, or do I host something myself? In the list of alternatives below, I will divide them into these two categories. Depending on what you want to do, you can then check out the relevant options.
